Automatically generate better error reporting with ApiProblem

## Synopsis

Produces a consistent consumable json response when a problem arises in an
Apigility project.

## Example

*example needed*

## Motivation

Common errors, such as incorrect column names or integrity violations, 
continue to crop up during development or usage. Instead of throwing an error
or exception, this allows consumers/developers to more easily figure out
what is happening. 

## Installation

*installation needed*

## Tests

*Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.*

## Contributors

*Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.*
